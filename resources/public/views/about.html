    <h3>Information about the study</h3>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Currently, the involvement of patients in regulatory and reimbursement decision-making is characterised by the involvement of small numbers of patients or their representatives. While these views on the value of a new treatment have an important role to play in the process, they risk being perceived as unreliable and not fully representing the preferences and views across the intended treatment population.</p>

    <p>Quantitative preference elicitation techniques offer a means for a more transparent and consistent inclusion of patient perspectives in medicines approval and reimbursement decisions. Incorporating formally elicited and statistically robust preferences would ultimately provide a much more robust involvement of patients in decisions about the value of treatments and provide a higher degree of certainty to the decision in question.</p>

    <h4>Purpose of the study</h4>
    <p>There is little work to date on patient preferences in myeloma. This project seeks to enhance the evidence base around myeloma patient preferences while contributing to the debate around formal preference elicitation methodologies and best practice currently being explored by regulators, industry, and researchers across Europe.</p>

    <h4>Procedures</h4>
    <p>We will provide information about different outcomes (both positive and negative) of medicines for the treatment of myeloma. We would like you to tell us how much you value each of these outcomes. Different people will feel that some of these outcomes are more important to them than others, so it’s important that you tell us about the values that are right for you personally.</p>

    <p>The information that we provide does not aim to cover all the care and treatments that are available and their outcomes and is not intended to replace the information and discussions needed to make informed decisions about treatment and care.</p>

    <h4>Duration</h4>
    <p>The survey is divided into four distinct parts that each contain a different set of questions. Preceding each of these sections is an introductory page explaining the type of question considered in this part. Completing all the questions will take you approximately 30 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Risks associated with participating in this activity</h4>
    <p>You may be uncomfortable thinking about some of the outcomes that we present and this could be upsetting for you. Please be ensured that you do not have to continue if you don’t wish to do so. At any stage in the process, you will therefore be given the opportunity to quit the survey.</p>

    <h4>Benefits from participating in this activity</h4>
    <p>There will be no direct benefit to you, but your participation will help us understand the range of outcomes and aspects of treatment and care that myeloma patients’ value, the relative importance these factors may have to each other, and the variability between patients’ individual patient preferences.</p>
    <p>Understanding patients’ preferences with respect to treatment and health utilities is crucial for doctors to deliver optimal quality of care to their patients. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is not enough consideration of the level of risk that patients would be willing to accept for the potential benefits of a treatment. The consequence of not understanding the factors that shape personal preferences and supporting patients to express these could negatively affect patient experience, adherence to treatment, and the efficient allocation of scarce resources.</p>
    <p>Improving understanding of patient preferences also has broader implications for the health service and the economy: supporting commissioners to more accurately estimate future demand on resources, health technology assessment bodies and regulators to value new treatments based on a more effective evaluation of benefit, risk and cost and influencing the development of patient-centred research.</p>

    <h4>Reimbursement</h4>
    <p>Unfortunately, we cannot provide any kind of reimbursement or incentive for you taking part in this activity.</p>

    <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
    <p>Via a questionnaire, we will collect information about how you value different outcomes in the treatment of myeloma. We will also collect information about your demographics and disease history. This information will be used to determine whether there are specific characteristics that can explain why some patients have other preferences than other patients.</p>

    <p>The responses that we collect will be stored on a secure server that can only be accessed by authorized members of the research team. For statistical purposes, all the data will be anonymised, meaning that the results of the study cannot be traced back to you as a person.</p>

    <h4>Sharing the results</h4>
    <p>The overall results will initially be shared between the European Medicines Agency, Myeloma UK, and the University Medical Center Groningen. The aggregated results from the questionnaire may also be published so that other interested people may learn from the research.</p>

    <h4>Right to refuse or withdraw</h4>
    <p>Your participation in this activity is entirely voluntary. It is your choice whether to participate or not. If you choose to participate, you may stop filling in the questionnaire at any time.</p>

    <h4>Contact information</h4>
    <p>This study is being conducted under a collaborative agreement between the European Medicines Agency, Myeloma UK, and the University Medical Center Groningen. If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about this activity, its procedures, and the risks and benefits, you can contact [TODO: who should be mentioned as the primary contact person?].</p>
