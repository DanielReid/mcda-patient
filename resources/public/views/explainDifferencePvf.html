    <h3>Part 1 &mdash; Relative value of different levels of achievement on each treatment outcome</h3>
    <p>Suppose that you just won a car in a lottery. Although you are obviously thrilled to have won a car, the relative value that you attach to this prize is likely to depend on the number of cars that you already own. For example, imagine that the value you attach to this new car is higher if you do not yet have a car compared to when you currently already own two cars. We then say that the marginal value of one additional car decreases as the total number of cars increases.</p>
    <p>For the treatment of myeloma, it may similarly hold that the relative value you attach to a certain improvement in treatment outcome (one more car) depends on the absolute level of achievement on this outcome (zero or two cars). In the first part of the survey, we will determine, for each of the outcomes separately, whether the marginal value associated with a certain improvement on this outcome (i) remains constant, (ii) increases, (iii) decreases, (iv) first increases, then decreases, or (v) first decreases, then increases.</p>
    <p>For each treatment outcome, this will be achieved by asking between 3 to 6 questions. In total, this part of the survey will therefore consist of {{nCriteria * 3}}&ndash;{{nCriteria * 6}} questions.</p>
