<h5>Trade-off questions</h5>
<p>Next we will ask trade-off questions. Trade-off questions are those where you will be asked to express by how much the performance of one criterion has to be improved to compensate for a worsening in the performance on another criterion by a specific amount.</p>

<p>You will be asked to judge by how much the effect on one outcome needs to be improved to compensate for a worsening in the effect on another outcome by a specific amount. In our setting, an improvement can either be a higher probability of experiencing a good outcome or a lower probability of experiencing a bad outcome. Similarly, a worsening can either be a higher probability of experiencing a bad outcome or a lower probability of experiencing a good outcome. For example, consider a treatment for which the probability of surviving the first 12 months is 40% and the probability of severe side-effects is 10%. Now, consider another treatment for which the probability of severe side-effects is 35%.</p>

<p>Although this second treatment increases the probability of severe side-effects (worsening), you may still prefer it over the first treatment if the second treatment increases the probability of surviving the first 12 months (improvement) by a sufficiently large amount. The purpose of this second part of the exercise is to establish when you consider the increase in the probability of surviving the first 12 months sufficient to accept an increase in the probability of severe side-effects from 10% to 35%. </p>

<p>Rather than asking for this directly, you will be asked to consider multiple treatments that all have a 35% probability of severe side-effects but that differ with respect to the probability of surviving the first 12 months. Your task is then to state for each of these treatments whether you would prefer this treatment or the alternative treatment that has a 10% probability of severe side-effects and a 40% probability of surviving the first 12 months.</p>
