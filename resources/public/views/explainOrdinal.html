  <h3>Relative importance of one outcome over another (part 1)</h3>

  <p>Next, you will be asked to consider a hypothetical treatment that performs relatively poorly with respect to each of the included outcomes.</p>

  <p>You will also be provided with a list of improvements that you can use to upgrade (step-by-step) the performance of this treatment until you have constructed a treatment that performs relatively well with respect to all these outcomes.</p>

  <p>The order in which you select these improvements determines how you value the different outcomes from most important to least important.</p>

  <p>In total, this part of the survey will consist of {{ nCriteria - 1 }} questions.</p>
