    <h3>Part 2 &mdash; Relative importance of one treatment outcome over another</h3>

    <p>In the second part of the survey, you will be asked to consider
    a hypothetical treatment that performs relatively poorly with
    respect to each of the included outcomes.</p>

    <p>You will also be provided with a list of improvements that you
    can use to upgrade (step-by-step) the performance of this
    treatment until you have constructed a treatment that performs
    relatively well with respect to all these outcomes.</p>

    <p>The order in which you select these improvements determines how
    you value the different outcomes from most important to least
    important.</p>

    <p>In total, this part of the survey will consist of {{ nCriteria - 1 }} questions.</p>
